# filogie.website

Statamic 6 site for filogie.website.

## Tech stack

- **CMS:** Statamic 6 (flat-file content + flat-file users)
- **Framework:** Laravel 13
- **PHP:** 8.4 (FPM)
- **DB:** SQLite (local, CI, production — bind-mounted host file in prod)
- **Local dev:** Laravel Sail (Docker)
- **Production runtime:** Docker on a VPS — `app` (php-fpm) + `nginx` (app-level web server) containers, no Sail
- **Container registry:** GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/studio-guez/filogie.website`)
- **TLS / public routing:** handled OUTSIDE this repository by a reverse proxy installed directly on each target server (e.g. system Nginx, Caddy, or Traefik). This project only publishes the app on a loopback port; the host-level reverse proxy terminates TLS and forwards traffic to it.
- **Frontend:** Vite + Tailwind (built in CI, baked into the production image)
- **CI:** GitHub Actions, SQLite-backed
- **Deploy:** GitHub Actions → build image → push to GHCR → self-hosted runner on target server → `docker compose up -d`. Two environments: `preprod` branch → preproduction server, `main` branch → production server.

### Useful Sail commands

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan ...   # any artisan command
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev   # Vite dev server
./vendor/bin/sail test          # phpunit
./vendor/bin/sail shell         # bash inside the container
```

## Image compression (public/images)

Static decorative/background images in `public/images` (parallax shapes,
section backgrounds, etc.) are **not** served through Glide. Source files in
that folder are assumed to already be @2x (retina) assets. A script converts
them to WebP and generates a half-size 1x variant for use in `srcset`:

```bash
./scripts/convert-images-to-webp.sh
```

This runs directly on the host (requires ImageMagick's `convert`, not run
inside Sail) and produces, for every `.jpg`/`.jpeg`/`.png` in `public/images`:

- `<name>.webp` — 2x version (original dimensions)
- `<name>@1x.webp` — 1x version (half width/height)

Optional arguments: `./scripts/convert-images-to-webp.sh [directory] [quality]`
(defaults: `public/images`, quality `82`). Re-run it whenever a source image
in `public/images` is added or replaced, and commit the generated `.webp`
files alongside it.

## File-based Statamic users and content

Statamic uses a flat-file user repository (`config/statamic/users.php` →
`'repository' => 'file'`) and flat-file content.

**Content config files** (`content/**/*` — collection definitions, global set schemas,
asset container configs) are **tracked in git** and baked into the image; they are
not bind-mounted.

**Real content** (`content/**/**` — entries, localized globals, nav trees, etc.) and
`users/` are **not tracked in git**. They are bind-mounted from the host so CP edits
persist across deploys.

Roles and groups (`resources/users/{roles,groups}.yaml`) are version-controlled.

## Deployment architecture

This repository is **only** responsible for building and shipping an
application container image. It is **not** responsible for TLS, virtual-host
routing, or any other reverse-proxy concern — those are handled by a reverse
proxy (e.g. system Nginx, Caddy, or Traefik) installed directly on each
target server, completely outside this project.

The deployed stack contains exactly two services (see
`docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml`):

- `app`   — php-fpm 8.4 running Statamic/Laravel
- `nginx` — the app-level web server that talks to php-fpm and serves the
  built static assets out of the shared `app-public` volume

The `nginx` service publishes only on `127.0.0.1:${APP_HTTP_PORT:-8080}`. The
host's reverse proxy must forward the public domain to that loopback port.

There is no Sail, no `composer`, and no `npm` on the target servers — only
Docker, the application stack above, and the host-level reverse proxy.

### Two environments

| Branch    | GitHub Environment | Image tags pushed                                          | Where it deploys                |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `preprod` | `preprod`          | `preprod-sha-<sha7>`, `preprod`                            | preproduction server            |
| `main`    | `production`       | `sha-<sha7>`, `latest`                                     | production server               |
| tag `v*`  | `production`       | `sha-<sha7>`, `latest`                                     | production server               |

Each environment uses its own GitHub Environment (`preprod` / `production`)
to store secrets. Production secrets are never visible to the preprod job
and vice versa. Both deploys reuse a single build job (`build-image`) so the
image is built once per push; only the deploy step is split per environment,
each running on a self-hosted runner registered on the corresponding server.

`workflow_dispatch` accepts a `target` input (`preprod` or `production`) for
one-off manual deploys.

```bash
# Trigger a manual deploy to preproduction
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref preprod -f target=preprod

# Trigger a manual deploy to production
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main -f target=production
```

### Layout on each target server

```
$DEPLOY_PATH/                            # e.g. /srv/filogie (preprod and prod use separate hosts and may use separate paths)
├── current -> releases/<ts>-<sha7>     # symlink to active compose bundle
├── releases/<ts>-<sha7>/               # docker/compose/ + docker/prod/
└── shared/
    ├── .env                            # environment-specific env (chmod 640)

    ├── current-tag.txt                 # image tag currently running
    ├── last-tag.txt                    # previous tag, for rollback
    └── backups/db-*.sqlite             # nightly DB backups
```

`$DEPLOY_PATH/shared/database/database.sqlite` lives on the **host
filesystem**, outside any container, outside any release directory. Image
rebuilds and rollbacks cannot touch it.

### One-time server setup (per environment)

Do this once on **each** target server (preproduction and production are
separate hosts). Replace `/srv/filogie` with whatever you set as `DEPLOY_PATH`
in that environment's secrets if different.

As root on Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg sqlite3 rsync python3
install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg \
  | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) stable" \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
apt update && apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io \
                             docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" deploy
usermod -aG docker deploy

sudo -u deploy mkdir -p \
  /srv/filogie/{releases,shared/{database,storage,backups,content,users}}

# UID 1000 == www-data inside the production image
sudo -u deploy touch /srv/filogie/shared/database/database.sqlite
sudo -u deploy sqlite3 /srv/filogie/shared/database/database.sqlite \
  "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;"
chown -R 1000:1000 /srv/filogie/shared/{database,storage,content,users}

# The deploy workflow seeds shared/.env (from .env.example) and shared/public/robots.txt
# automatically on first deploy. After that, edit shared/.env with real values:
nano /srv/filogie/shared/.env

# Authenticate the server to GHCR for image pulls
echo "$GHCR_PAT" | sudo -u deploy docker login ghcr.io -u <gh-user> --password-stdin

# Register the GitHub Actions self-hosted runner (repeat for each environment)
# Download the runner package from: Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner
# Follow the instructions shown there, then install as a service:
sudo ./svc.sh install deploy   # run as the deploy user
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

The runner must be registered with the label matching the workflow:
- preprod job: `self-hosted`, `filogie`, `docker`
- production job: `self-hosted`, `filogie-prod`, `docker`

Generate an `APP_KEY` once and paste it into the environment's `.env`
(`latest` for production, `preprod` for preproduction):

```bash
sudo -u deploy docker run --rm ghcr.io/studio-guez/filogie.website:<latest|preprod> \
  php artisan key:generate --show
```

### First deploy

After triggering the first deploy (push to `preprod` / `main`, or via
`gh workflow run`), the pipeline seeds `shared/.env` from `.env.example` and
starts the stack. The app won't be fully operational until you fill in real
values. SSH in and follow these steps:

```bash
ssh deploy@<server>

# Set these once for the whole session.
# APP_IMAGE_TAG: use "latest" on production, "preprod" on preproduction.
export DEPLOY_PATH=<deploy_path>
export SHARED_PATH="$DEPLOY_PATH/shared"
export APP_IMAGE_TAG=latest          # or: preprod
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=filogie  # or your project name
alias dc="docker compose -f $DEPLOY_PATH/current/docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml"

# 1. Create the first Statamic admin user.
dc exec app php artisan statamic:make:user

# 2. Generate APP_KEY — must use --show because the container has no writable .env.
dc exec app php artisan key:generate --show
# → copy the "base64:..." output

# 3. Fill in the real environment values.
#    At minimum: APP_KEY (from above), APP_URL, APP_ENV, and any mail / licence keys.
nano "$SHARED_PATH/.env"

# 4. Restart the app container so it picks up the new env.
dc restart app

# 5. Re-warm the caches (the first boot used the placeholder .env).
dc exec app sh -c "
    php artisan config:cache &&
    php artisan route:cache &&
    php artisan view:cache &&
    php artisan event:cache &&
    php artisan statamic:stache:warm
  "

# 6. (Preprod only — optional) Enable HTTP Basic Auth.
#    The nginx container mounts $SHARED_PATH/auth/ into /etc/nginx/auth/ (read-only).
#    Leave the directory empty to disable auth (nginx's glob matches nothing).

# Generate the htpasswd file (openssl is always available — no extra packages needed)
printf '%s:%s\n' "filogie" "$(openssl passwd -apr1 'your-password')" \
  > "$SHARED_PATH/auth/.htpasswd"
chmod 644 "$SHARED_PATH/auth/.htpasswd"

# Create the nginx config that activates Basic Auth
cat > "$SHARED_PATH/auth/auth.conf" <<'EOF'
auth_basic "Preprod";
auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/auth/.htpasswd;
EOF

# Reload nginx (no restart needed)
dc exec nginx nginx -s reload

# To disable auth later: remove the files and reload.
# rm "$SHARED_PATH/auth/auth.conf" "$SHARED_PATH/auth/.htpasswd"
# dc exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

### Host-level reverse proxy (out of scope for this repo)

The application stack only exposes `127.0.0.1:${APP_HTTP_PORT:-8080}`. TLS
termination, HTTP→HTTPS redirection, hostname routing, and certificate
management must be configured **on the host**, completely outside this
repository.

Any standard reverse proxy installed on the server works (system `nginx`,
`caddy`, `traefik`, …). It only needs to forward the public domain to that
loopback port. Example sketches:

- system **nginx**: a `server { listen 443 ssl; … proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080; }` block per environment
- system **Caddy**: `preprod.example.com { reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 }`

If `8080` collides with something else on a given server, set
`APP_HTTP_PORT` in that environment's shell or in `/srv/filogie/shared/.env`
before bringing the stack up.

### Manual deploy (when CI/CD is unavailable)

If the runner is offline or you need to deploy out-of-band, you can trigger
the same sequence manually after the image has been pushed to GHCR:

```bash
ssh deploy@<server>
cd /srv/filogie/current

# Pick the tag from the GitHub Actions "build & push" step output
export APP_IMAGE_TAG=preprod-sha-<sha7>    # or sha-<sha7> for production
export SHARED_PATH=/srv/filogie/shared

# Pull the new image
docker compose -f docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml pull

# Run migrations (one-shot container against the shared DB)
docker run --rm \
  --env-file "${SHARED_PATH}/.env" \
  -e RUN_MIGRATIONS=true \
  -v "${SHARED_PATH}/database:/var/www/html/database" \
  ghcr.io/studio-guez/filogie.website:${APP_IMAGE_TAG} \
  php artisan migrate --force

# Replace the running containers
APP_IMAGE_TAG=${APP_IMAGE_TAG} \
SHARED_PATH=${SHARED_PATH} \
docker compose -f docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

> **Note:** if the `app-public` volume needs refreshing (CSS/JS changed), drop it first:
> ```bash
> docker compose -f docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml down -v
> docker compose -f docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml up -d
> ```

---

### What happens on `git push`

1. `ci.yml` runs lint + tests on SQLite (for both `main` and `preprod`, plus PRs).
2. `deploy.yml`:
   - `build-image` builds `docker/prod/Dockerfile` once and pushes to GHCR.
     - `preprod` branch → tags `preprod-sha-<sha7>` and `preprod`
     - `main` branch (or `v*` tag) → tags `sha-<sha7>` and `latest`
   - `deploy-preprod` runs **only** for `preprod` (uses the `preprod` GitHub Environment).
   - `deploy-production` runs **only** for `main` / `v*` (uses the `production` GitHub Environment).
3. The chosen deploy job runs directly on a self-hosted runner registered on
   the target server. It extracts the compose bundle (`docker/compose/`,
   `docker/prod/`, `.env.example`, `public/robots.txt`, `public/.htaccess`)
   into a new release directory.
4. On the target server:
   - SQLite is backed up online-safely via Python's built-in `sqlite3` module.
   - The new image is `docker pull`-ed.
   - `php artisan migrate --force` runs in a one-shot container against the
     shared SQLite file.
   - The `current` symlink is flipped.
   - `docker compose ... up -d` replaces `app` and `nginx`.
   - Laravel + Statamic caches are warmed.
   - Old releases and dangling images are pruned.

### Required GitHub Actions secrets

Secrets are scoped to **GitHub Environments** so that the preproduction
deploy job cannot read production secrets and vice versa. Configure each
environment under **Settings → Environments → `preprod`** and
**Settings → Environments → `production`** with the same key names but the
environment-appropriate values:

| Secret              | Scope                 | Purpose                                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEPLOY_PATH`       | per environment       | e.g. `/srv/filogie`                                                  |
| `GHCR_PULL_TOKEN`   | per environment       | PAT with `read:packages`, used by the runner to pull from GHCR      |
| `GHCR_PULL_USER`    | per environment (opt) | GHCR username for the pull token (defaults to actor)                 |
| `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` | per environment (opt) | Docker Compose project name (defaults to `filogie`)               |
| `COMPOSER_AUTH`     | repository (optional) | JSON for private Composer packages, used at build time               |

All app secrets (`APP_KEY`, mail credentials, Statamic license, etc.) live
in `$DEPLOY_PATH/shared/.env` on each target server — **never** in workflow
files or git. Use a different `APP_KEY` and different external credentials
per environment.

### Seeding shared files

The deploy workflow (`deploy` action) bootstraps the shared directory
automatically on every deploy. Each step is a no-op when the target already exists:

| Target on host | Source |
|---|---|
| `$SHARED_PATH/.env` | `.env.example` — edit with real values before the stack starts |
| `$SHARED_PATH/public/robots.txt` | `public/robots.txt` (git-tracked default) |
| `$SHARED_PATH/public/.htaccess` | `public/.htaccess` (git-tracked default) |
| `$SHARED_PATH/{database,storage,content,users,public}/` | created as empty directories |

**`robots.txt` — git-tracked default, host-overridable**

The git-tracked `public/robots.txt` is baked into every image and used automatically.
If `$SHARED_PATH/public/robots.txt` exists on the host, the container entrypoint
overlays it onto `public/robots.txt` on every start, so you can customise it per
environment (e.g. `Disallow: /` on preprod) without rebuilding.

**`.env` — bootstrapped from `.env.example`**

The compose file mounts `$SHARED_PATH/.env` as `env_file`; the stack refuses to start
if the file is missing. On first deploy the workflow copies `.env.example` as a
starting point so the full list of required variables is visible. Never commit real
secrets to git.

---

### Running the production image locally

You can smoke-test the built image without any reverse proxy:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/database:/var/www/html/database \
  ghcr.io/studio-guez/filogie.website:latest
```

Because the production image runs php-fpm (not a full web server) on its
own, the loopback test above is mostly useful as a sanity check that the
image boots, runs migrations and caches. For a full local end-to-end test of
the compose stack, run the compose file against a throwaway shared dir:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/filogie-shared/{database,storage,content,users,public,backups}
touch /tmp/filogie-shared/database/database.sqlite
cp .env.example /tmp/filogie-shared/.env   # then edit APP_KEY etc.
cp public/robots.txt /tmp/filogie-shared/public/robots.txt
cp public/.htaccess /tmp/filogie-shared/public/.htaccess

APP_IMAGE_TAG=latest \
SHARED_PATH=/tmp/filogie-shared \
APP_HTTP_PORT=8080 \
docker compose -f docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml up
```

Then browse to <http://127.0.0.1:8080>.

### Preprod HTTP Basic Auth

The nginx container mounts `$SHARED_PATH/auth/` into `/etc/nginx/auth/` (read-only).
nginx's glob `include /etc/nginx/auth/*.conf` silently matches nothing when the
directory is empty — so production gets no auth by default.

To password-protect the preprod environment, SSH into the preprod server and run once:

```bash
# 1. Generate the htpasswd file (no extra packages needed — openssl is always available)
printf '%s:%s\n' "filogie" "$(openssl passwd -apr1 'your-password')" \
  > /srv/filogie/shared/auth/.htpasswd
chmod 644 /srv/filogie/shared/auth/.htpasswd

# 2. Create the nginx config that activates Basic Auth
cat > /srv/filogie/shared/auth/auth.conf <<'EOF'
auth_basic "Preprod";
auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/auth/.htpasswd;
EOF

# 3. Reload nginx (no restart needed)
docker compose -f /srv/filogie/current/docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

To **disable** auth: remove the files and reload.
```bash
rm /srv/filogie/shared/auth/auth.conf /srv/filogie/shared/auth/.htpasswd
docker compose -f /srv/filogie/current/docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

The `.htpasswd` and `auth.conf` files persist across deploys (they live in `shared/auth/`,
outside any release directory) and require no image rebuild.

### Rollback

```bash
ssh deploy@<server>
PREV=$(cat /srv/filogie/shared/last-tag.txt)
APP_IMAGE_TAG=$PREV \
SHARED_PATH=/srv/filogie/shared \
docker compose -f /srv/filogie/current/docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml up -d

# If a schema change is involved, restore the pre-deploy DB snapshot:
# docker compose -f /srv/filogie/current/docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml stop app
# cp /srv/filogie/shared/backups/db-<ts>.sqlite \
#    /srv/filogie/shared/database/database.sqlite
# docker compose -f /srv/filogie/current/docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml start app
```

### Running artisan on a deployed server

```bash
ssh deploy@<server>
docker compose -f /srv/filogie/current/docker/compose/compose.prod.yaml \
  exec app php artisan tinker
```

### SQLite backup / restore

The DB is just a host file — backups run on the host, no container involvement:

```bash
sqlite3 /srv/filogie/shared/database/database.sqlite \
  ".backup '/srv/filogie/shared/backups/db-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).sqlite'"
```

Add a nightly cron (`restic backup /srv/filogie/shared/backups` is a good
off-site choice).

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom                       | Fix                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `database is locked`          | Confirm WAL mode and that only one `app` container is running.                                                     |
| 502 from the host reverse proxy | `docker compose logs app` — usually a missing `.env` or wrong `DB_DATABASE` path. Also check the host proxy is forwarding to `127.0.0.1:${APP_HTTP_PORT:-8080}`. |
| Permission denied on storage  | `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /srv/filogie/shared/{storage,database}`                                                     |
| CSS/JS 404 after deploy       | The shared `app-public` volume wasn't refreshed: `docker volume rm filogie_app-public && docker compose ... up -d`.  |
| Stale opcache                 | The container is replaced every deploy; if you see staleness anyway, restart `app`.                                |
| `docker pull` fails on server | Re-authenticate to GHCR: `echo $PAT \| docker login ghcr.io -u <user> --password-stdin`                            |
| Lost CP-edited users/content  | Check that the content sub-dirs (`collections/pages`, `globals/fr`, `trees/collections`) and `users/` are bind-mounted on the host and owned by UID 1000. |
| Frontend pages all return 404, CP works fine | The app is behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy but `TRUSTED_PROXIES` is not wired up. Laravel ignores `X-Forwarded-Proto` and sees all requests as plain HTTP, causing Statamic's frontend URL matching to break while CP controller routes keep working. Fix: ensure `$SHARED_PATH/.env` contains `TRUSTED_PROXIES=*` (and `FORCE_HTTPS=true` for HTTPS sites). `bootstrap/app.php` reads `TRUSTED_PROXIES` and `AppServiceProvider` reads `FORCE_HTTPS` — both must be set. Restart and re-warm: `dc restart app && dc exec app php artisan config:cache`. |
| Mixed-content errors (CSS/JS loaded over `http://` on an `https://` page) | Set `FORCE_HTTPS=true` in `$SHARED_PATH/.env`. `AppServiceProvider` calls `URL::forceScheme('https')` when this flag is set. Also ensure `TRUSTED_PROXIES=*` is set so that `request()->isSecure()` correctly returns `true` for proxied HTTPS requests. After editing the file restart the app and re-warm the config cache: `dc restart app && dc exec app php artisan config:cache`. |
